***Why I made it***: This is made for people who requested me for Linux setup scripts, which include apps that the person wanted on their machine.
***How to use them***
1. Clone the repository. To do this, go to the terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/mys31f/personalrequests.git`
2. Change your directory: Type in `cd ~/personalrequests/your_name` 
E.g: `cd ~/personalrequests/Maestro`
3. Type this in to initiate the script: `sh setup.sh`
